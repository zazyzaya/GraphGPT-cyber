Most of the results reported are from the Argus paper, as they tested quite a few models on their own for their paper. However, UNSW has not been previously tested. For a fair comparison, we have tried our best to implement the Euler, Argus, and Pikachu models here and evaluate them on the UNSW dataset. In most cases, they were copied from their respective repositories, but Pikachu was written in Keras, not PyTorch, so we had to implement it from scratch.
